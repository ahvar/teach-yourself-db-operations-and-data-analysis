To solve the problem in consecutive_numbers_pandas.py (see problem.txt), you need to find numbers (num) that appear at least three times consecutively in the logs DataFrame.

Here’s a step-by-step walk-through of the pandas operations:

1. Identify Consecutive Groups
Use shift() to compare each row’s num with the previous row.
When the value changes, it marks a new group.
You can use cumsum() on this change to assign a unique group number
to each consecutive block.

logs['group'] = (logs['num'] != logs['num'].shift()).cumsum()

2. Count the Size of Each Group
Group by both group and num to get the size of each consecutive block.

group_sizes = logs.groupby(['group', 'num']).size().reset_index(name='count')

3. Filter Groups With At Least 3 Consecutive Occurrences
Select groups where count >= 3:

at_least_three = group_sizes[group_sizes['count'] >= 3]

4. Get Unique Numbers
Extract the unique num values from these groups:
result = at_least_three['num'].unique()

5. Format the Output
If you want the result as a DataFrame with the required column name:

output = pd.DataFrame({'ConsecutiveNums': result})
